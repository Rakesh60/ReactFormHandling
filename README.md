# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

### The FormData interface provides a way to construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values.

### An object implementing FormData can directly be used in a for...of structure, instead of entries(): for (const p of myFormData) is equivalent to for (const p of myFormData.entries()).

#Constructor

### FormData()

Creates a new FormData object.

### FormData.entries()

Returns an iterator that iterates through all key/value pairs contained in the FormData.
